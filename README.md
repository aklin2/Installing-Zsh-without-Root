Installing Zsh without Root access

Use the installer.sh
You should also read it before runnning it.
Probably needs some cleaning up, but it should work, else ping @aklin2 (alan) to fix it.

Useful references:
Built this entirely off of this page:
https://www.drewsilcock.co.uk/compiling-zsh
^ You can skip the icmake and yodl. I didn't include them in installer.sh
The ncurses link in the above did not work for me, so I used a different one for installer.sh

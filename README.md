# Installing-Zsh-without-Root
### Installing Zsh without Root access

Use the installer.sh

You should also read it before runnning it.
Probably needs some cleaning up, but it should work, else ping @aklin2 (alan) to fix it.


### AFTER INSTALLING

Run zsh by just doing `zsh` - and it should give you a powerlevel10k configuration prompt.

If not, just run p10k in zsh shell.

You may want to install some of the official fonts.

See this for more details:

### Useful references:

Built this entirely off of this page:

https://www.drewsilcock.co.uk/compiling-zsh

^ You can skip the icmake and yodl. I didn't include them in installer.sh
The ncurses link in the above did not work for me, so I used a different one for installer.sh
